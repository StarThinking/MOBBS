.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBceph\fP [ \-m \fImonaddr\fP ] [ \-w | \fIcommand\fP ... ]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBceph\fP is a control utility for communicating with the monitor
cluster of a running Ceph distributed file system.
.sp
There are three basic modes of operation.
.SS Interactive mode
.sp
To start in interactive mode, no arguments are necessary. Control\-d or
\(aqquit\(aq will exit.
.SS Watch mode
.sp
Watch mode shows cluster state changes as they occur. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph \-w
.ft P
.fi
.SS Command line mode
.sp
Finally, to send a single instruction to the monitor cluster (and wait
for a response), the command can be specified on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i infile
will specify an input file to be passed along as a payload with the
command to the monitor cluster. This is only used for specific
monitor commands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o outfile
will write any payload returned by the monitor cluster with its
reply to outfile.  Only specific monitor commands (e.g. osd getmap)
return a payload.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c ceph.conf, \-\-conf=ceph.conf
Use ceph.conf configuration file instead of the default
/etc/ceph/ceph.conf to determine monitor addresses during startup.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m monaddress[:port]
Connect to specified monitor (instead of looking through ceph.conf).
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To grab a copy of the current OSD map:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph \-m 1.2.3.4:6789 osd getmap \-o osdmap
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To get a dump of placement group (PG) state:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph pg dump \-o pg.txt
.ft P
.fi
