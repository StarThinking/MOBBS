In the filebench test, we need to test performance of three types of vbds under workloads generated by Filebench. The three types are ceph vbds involving ssd-vbd and hdd-vbd, and the third is vbd of WHOBBS. Therefore, this test includes 2 parts, one is the test using origial Ceph storage system and the other is its counterpart, namely based on WHOBBS.

Finished:
Tests using Ceph on two file systems (ext4, xfs) with the following workloads:
filebench, varmail, webserver, webproxy, videoserver

Unfinished:
Test using WHOBBS

Cleancache Interval: 5s
